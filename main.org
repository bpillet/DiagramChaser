* Presentation
** Visual
A grid where each point can be set in one of the following states
- '0' null and non-exact a priori
- '-' non-null and exact in the row
- '|' non-null and exact in the column
- '+' non-null and exact in both direction
- '@' non-null and non-exact a priori

Each segment between adjacent points represent a map and can be set to
- ' ' non-existant
- '->' directed map
- 'c->' injective map
- '->>' surjective map
- '~' isomorphism

Remark: Everything is supposed commutative

*** Exemple

 0 -> 0 -> - -> + -> @ -> 0
      |         | 
      v         v     
 0 -> + -> - -> + -> 0
      |    |    |
      v    v    v
 0 -> + -> + -> + -> 0
      |    |    |
      v    v    v
      0    0    0


** Features
- Construct maps between points when they exist
- Construct kernell and cokernell, shows vanishing
- Show isomorphisms
- Implement actual diagram chasing

* Implementation
- HTML + CSS + script ?
- Text-file + Ocaml (ou Lisp ou prolog) ?
